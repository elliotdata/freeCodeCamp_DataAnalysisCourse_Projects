## Data Analysis Certification Projects

Data analysis projects completed as part of freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certification. These projects showcase my ability to analyze and visualize data, utilizing various Python libraries and techniques.

### Project Summaries:

1. **Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator:**
   Created a function to calculate statistical measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation for a 3x3 matrix using NumPy. The function handles input validation and returns result in a structured format.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer:**
   Analyzed demographic data using Pandas. Explored aspects like race representation, the average age of men, and educational attainment percentages.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer:**
   Visualized medical examination data, uncovering relationships between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices. Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer:**
   Visualized time series data showing daily page views on freeCodeCamp's forum from 2016 to 2019. Created line charts, bar charts, and box plots using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

5. **Sea Level Predictor:**
   Analyzed and predicted global average sea level changes from 1880 - 2013. Utilized data visualization techniques and linear regression to visualize historical trends and predict future sea level changes.
